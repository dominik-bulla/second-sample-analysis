# second-sample-analysis
Second sample repository with excerpts to highlight some of my quantitative/ coding skills

Background: The client was a consortium of Germanyâ€™s biggest NGOs working with refugee/ IDP communities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The consortium initiated a project to strengthen child protection amongst refugees/ IDPs as well as their host communities. To guide programming, I was tasked to design a pre/ post evaluation design. As part of the evaluation design, a baseline was commissioned as well. I designed the baseline framework, which included of a multi-stage sampling design. Data was collected in country by local consultants. The data was collected using KOBO toolbox. The data was then pulled into R using an API. I used the data collected in country to perform the global baseline analysis. Within the current excerpt from the global baseline analysis, I determine the typical socio-demographic profile of primary caregivers that were interviewed across the different levels. To do so, I used sampling weights.
