# Project: Analysis of baseline legacy data (i.e., 2023)

# Background: The client was a consortium of Germanyâ€™s biggest NGOs working with refugee/ IDP communities in Asia, Africa, and 
# Latin America. The consortium initiated a project to strengthen child protection amongst refugees/ IDPs as well as their host 
# communities. To guide programming, I was tasked to design a pre/ post evaluation design. As part of the evaluation design, a 
# baseline was commissioned as well. I designed the baseline framework, which included of a multi-stage sampling design. Data 
# was collected in country by local consultants. The data was collected using KOBO toolbox. The data was then pulled into R using 
# an API. I used the data collected in country to perform the global baseline analysis. Within the current excerpt from the global 
# baseline analysis, I determine the typical socio-demographic profile of primary caregivers that were interviewed across the 
# different levels. To do so, I used sampling weights.
# Purpose: Clean up and make the data set ready for complex survey analysis
